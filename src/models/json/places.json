      "description": "<p>A winter night in Longyearbyen lasts 4 months. In the ice-covered mountains, the darkness is broken only by a slim concrete building that emits a pale blue glow as it overlooks the 1,000-resident town. The simple structure offers no hint as to what’s protected inside: a collection of seeds that could save humanity.</p><p>Due to the loss of genetic diversity among commercially cultivated crops, which tend to be grown from clonal monocultures, many worldwide food crops are at risk of disease. Mutated strains of fungus, or a new bacterium, could potentially wipe out an entire world crop in a matter of months, causing massive food shortages. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault was established by the Norwegian government in 2008 to function as a sort of genetic safe-deposit box.</p><p>The facility has the capacity to conserve 4.5 million seed samples. Under the current temperature conditions in the vault, which are similar to those in a kitchen freezer, the seed samples can remain viable to begin new crops for anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 years.</p><p>Svalbard was chosen as the location because it is tectonically stable and its permafrost provides natural refrigeration in case of a power failure. There is no permanent staff at the seed bank, but it is monitored constantly using electronic surveillance. Access to the vaults, open only to employees, requires passing four locked doors protected by coded access keys.</p>",

      "description": "<p>In False Bay—named in the 17th century by the disgruntled sailors who mistook it for adjacent Table Bay—lies a rocky strip of land overrun with seals. Around 60,000 of the barking, flopping, waddling brown fur seals jostle for space on the half-mile-long, 164-foot-wide (50 m) Seal Island.</p><p>From a tour boat, the cacophonous jostling is a compelling sight, but it’s the overwhelming smell—a unique bouquet of rotting fish and excrement—that makes the boldest impression. This, however, is before you view the effects of the “ring of death,” a circle of great white sharks that surrounds the island waiting for seals to enter the water. When they do, the sharks pursue them relentlessly.</p><p>It’s not unusual to see a great white suddenly breach the surface and hurtle into the air with a seal struggling in its jaws. The sharks are fast, brutal, and capable of chomping seals to death in under a minute. It’s a violent sight, and you can’t help but root for the seal. Sometimes, after a thrilling battle, they get away.</p>",
